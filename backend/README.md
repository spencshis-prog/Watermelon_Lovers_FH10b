# Watermelon Lover Backend üçâ

This is the backend component of the **Watermelon Lover** project, a senior design project developed at the **University of Texas at Austin**. The backend will handle core functionalities like machine learning model inference, data processing, and integration with the frontend for evaluating watermelon ripeness and quality.

---

## Project Structure

Currently, this directory is under development and will include:

- **Data processing scripts**: To handle acoustic and visual inputs.
- **Machine learning models**: For predicting watermelon ripeness based on input data.
- **API endpoints**: For communication with the frontend.

---

## Prerequisites

To prepare for development, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.9 or later**
- Additional dependencies (to be specified in a `requirements.txt` file).

---

## Development Status

The backend is currently under active development. Planned features include:

1. **ML Model Integration**:
   - CNN for visual analysis.
   - Signal processing for acoustic evaluation.

2. **API Design**:
   - RESTful endpoints to accept data from the frontend and return processed results.

3. **Deployment**:
   - Hosting solutions (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
